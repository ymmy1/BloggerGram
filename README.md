# Welcome to BloggerGram!

Hi! My name is Oleg Nosyrev and this is the Final Project for the CS50 by Harvard (2020).

# BloggerGram

This project is a mini version of Instagram. The main idea is to let people register, login and view and interact with the page of the blogger.
## What can user do
 Besides registering and logging in user can do the following:

 **1. Change their nicknames**
 **2. Expand the images**
 **3. Like blogger's posts**
 **4. Comment blogger's posts**

## Improvments

 There are tons of improvments ahead, please feel free to email me your ideas how to make this blog better or cleaner(code)
 I will be happy to hear some feedback! (contacts inside the website)
